Macalester College 2022 Datafest

This R-Markdown was written in RStudio by myself and a number of others who formed a team for the Macalester College Datafest. Datafest is a national statistics 
competiotion held at more than thirty colleges every year. The competition takes place over one weekend, in which all teams have only that weekend to analyze an unkown
and large dataset, frame a research question, and present conclusions. The R-Markdown above lays out our data cleaning and visualization process, and the linked video 
is a presentation of our overall process and conclusions.
